# A Simple K-Means Algorithm Aade From Scratch
The initial starting points for the K cluster means are be K randomly selected data points. You have an 
option to run the algorithm r times from r different randomly chosen initializations (e.g., r = 10), 
where it then selects the solution that gives the lowest sum of squares error over the r runs.
Once the algorithm finishes, it creates a 2-d plot with the data points and clusters.  

Dataset: The data set is 2d data (for ease of visualization) simulated from 3 Gaussians, with 
considerable overlap. There are 500 points from each Gaussian, ordered together in the file.
